<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p>
The aim of the challenge is to start to compare various constraint
solving technology on the same problems sets. The focus is on finite
domain propagation solvers. An auxiliary aim is to build up a library
of interesting problem models, which can be used to compare solvers
and solving technologies.
<p>
Entrants to the challenge provide a FlatZinc solver and a copy
of globals.mzn specialized for their solver. 
Each solver is run on 100 MiniZinc model(+instance)s.  
We run the translator <tt>mzn2fzn</tt> on the MiniZinc model and instance
using the provided globals.mzn file to create a FlatZinc file.
The FlatZinc file is input to the provided solver.
Points are awarded for solving problems, speed of solution, and goodness
of solutions (for optimization problems).
<P>
We realise the time lines are shortish for the challenge and in this
first instance things may be quite fluid.

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>
This is the first time this challenge has been run, and there are many 
possibilities for comparing CP solvers. The rules tries to make a sensible
set of choices for the comparison. 
We would welcome any comments or suggestions 
regarding the running of this challenge.
