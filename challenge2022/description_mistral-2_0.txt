Mistral-2.0 is a C++ library under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE and is hosted on github: git@github.com:ehebrard/Mistral-2.0.git. The old version is still available here http://homepages.laas.fr/ehebrard/Software.html. 

The solver implements most arithmetic and logic primitive constraints as well as some global constraints (AllDifferent, Linear Equalities, Element, etc...). Standard search strategies and heuristics are also implemented (Restarts, Weighted Degree, Activity Based Search). It is still in a very early stage of development, so it is still very basic. The FlatZinc parser was adapted from the Flatzinc parser featured in Gecode.
