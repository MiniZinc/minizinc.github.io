Concrete is a CSP solving API developed in Scala. Current version is Concrete 3.4.

Entirely written in Scala, Concrete has been in development since 2005. It seeks functional purity as much as possible. Concrete also feature state-of-the-art algorithms for linear, binary and table constraints.

Concrete is also based upon a powerful modelling API called CSPOM. Current version is CSPOM 2.18, also written in Scala. CSPOM comes with a FlatZinc, XCSP 2.1 and XCSP 3 parsers, a Scala DSL and Java API. It also feature many automatic reformulation routines.
