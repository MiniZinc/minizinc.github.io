<h2>MiniZinc Challenge 2017</h2>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p>
The aim of the challenge is to start to compare various constraint
solving technology on the same problems sets. The focus is on finite
domain propagation solvers. An auxiliary aim is to build up a library
of interesting problem models, which can be used to compare solvers
and solving technologies.
<p>
Entrants to the challenge provide a FlatZinc or MiniZinc solver and global constraint
definitions specialized for their solver.
Each solver is run on 100 MiniZinc model instances.
For FlatZinc solvers, we run the translator <tt>mzn2fzn</tt> on the MiniZinc model and instance
using the provided global constraint definitions to create a FlatZinc file.
The FlatZinc file is input to the provided FlatZinc solver.
For MiniZinc solvers, the MiniZinc model and instance are input to the provided solver.
Points are awarded for solving problems, speed of solution, and goodness
of solutions (for optimization problems).

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>
Entrants must register their intention to enter the contest <em>before</em>
the first submission round.<br>
The first submission round is an opportunity for us to provide feedback
concerning your entry; it does not count towards the final result.<br>
Feel free to register and later withdraw.
</p>

<p>
To register send an email with the following subject line

<pre>
    <kbd>[MZNC17] registration</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
to
<pre>
    <kbd>mzn-challenge</kbd> 'at' <kbd>minizinc.org</kbd>
</pre>

<P>
In the body of the email please include an email address at which
we can contact you and the name of your solver.
</p>

<h3>Submission</h3>

<p>
We will provide submission details via email to the address provided
above.

<h3>Problem Submission</h3>

<p>
We strongly encourage all entrants to submit one or two MiniZinc models
satisfying the contest requirements, together with instances for these
models.  They can be submitted as tarballs to:
<pre>
    <kbd>mzn-challenge</kbd> 'at' <kbd>minizinc.org</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
The sooner they are submitted the better, the deadline is <strong>Sun, 22 May 2017</strong>.
The call for problem submission is available <a href="call_for_problems.html">here</a>. 
Please feel free to distribute it.

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
The rules for the MiniZinc Challenge 2017 are available 
<a href="rules2017.html">here</a>.<br>
If we need to make changes to the rules, all registered entrants will
be informed by email.

<h3>Judges</h3>

<p> The judges will be responsible for selecting the tested instances,
vetting the results, and ruling on any questions that arise during the competition.

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>
This is the tenth time this challenge is run, and there are many 
possibilities for comparing CP solvers. The rules try to make a sensible
set of choices for the comparison. 
We would welcome any comments or suggestions regarding the running of this challenge.
