        MiniSearch - A meta-search language for MiniZinc
      </h1>

      <p>
        MiniSearch is a meta-search language that extends MiniZinc with support for (heuristic) meta-searches, such as Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS),
        using any FlatZinc solver. Other meta-searches include lexicographic branch-and-bound, 
        And/Or search, diverse solution search and interactive search.
        Have look at our paper on MiniSearch:<br>
