This is "fzn-oscar-cbls", a MiniZinc backend using the Oscar/CBLS
solver. It solves problems by using constraint-based local search in
an adapative tabu search setting. Before running the search, the
backend looks for one-way constraints that can be implemented by
invariants and for implicit constraints that can be maintained during
search through specific neighbourhoods. During search the backend
performs propagation, using some parts of OscaR/CP, to reduce the size
of the search space.  The backend sometimes makes use of compound-move
generation (CMG), as described in [BFP19], on models that have
certain model structures. This is an experimental feature.


This backend has been described more in depth in [BMFP15] and has been
first developed as part of Gustav Björdal's bachelor thesis [Bjö14].
More info on OscaR can be found at http://www.oscarlib.org. The CBLS
engine of OscaR is developed at CETIC, Belgium, by Renaud De
Landtsheer, Yoann Guyot, and Gustavo Ospina. OscaR is free software
and distributed under the terms of the LGPL v2.1.
