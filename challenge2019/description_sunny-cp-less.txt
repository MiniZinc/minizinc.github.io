SUNNY-CP 2.2
============

SUNNY-CP: a Parallel CP Portfolio Solver

sunny-cp [5] is a parallel parallel portfolio solver that allows to solve a
Constraint (Satisfaction/Optimization) Problem defined in the MiniZinc language.
It essentially implements the SUNNY algorithm described in [1][2][3] and extends
its sequential version [4] that attended the MiniZinc Challenge 2014 [6].
sunny-cp is built on top of state-of-the-art constraint solvers, including:
Choco, Chuffed, G12/LazyFD, G12/FD, G12/Gurobi, Gecode, JaCoP, iZplus,
MinisatID, Mistral, Opturion, OR-Tools, Picat. These solvers are not included by
default in sunny-cp, except for those already included in the MiniZinc bundle
(i.e., G12/LazyFD, G12/FD, and Gecode). However, sunny-cp provides
utilities for adding new solvers to the portfolio and for customizing their
settings.

In a nutshell, sunny-cp relies on two sequential steps:

  1. PRE-SOLVING: consists in the parallel execution of a (maybe empty) static
     schedule and the neighborhood computation of underlying k-NN algorithm;

  2. SOLVING: consists in the parallel and cooperative execution of a number of
     the predicted solvers, selected by means of SUNNY algorithm.

sunny-cp won the gold medal in the open track of MiniZinc Challenges 2015-2017
[6].

This entry submission, differently from the previous ones, does not come with a
predefined knowledge base. Moreover, sunny-cp can now support the deployment by
suing the Docker container technology. By using Docker, sunny-cp can be also
installed as a microservice and accessed using simple HTTP post calls.
