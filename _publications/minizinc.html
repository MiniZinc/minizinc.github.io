There is no standard modelling language for constraint programming (CP)
problems. Most solvers have their own modelling language. This makes it
difficult for modellers to experiment with different solvers for a problem.
In this paper we present MiniZinc, a simple but expressive CP modelling
language which is suitable for modelling problems for a range of solvers and
provides a reasonable compromise between many design possibilities. Equally
importantly, we also propose a low-level solver-input language called
FlatZinc, and a straightforward translation from MiniZinc to FlatZinc that
preserves all solver-supported global constraints. This lets a solver writer
support MiniZinc with a minimum of effort - they only need to provide a
simple FlatZinc front-end to their solver, and then combine it with an
existing MiniZinc-to-FlatZinc translator. Such a front-end may then serve as
a stepping stone towards a full MiniZinc implementation that is more
tailored to the particular solver. A standard language for modelling CP
problems will encourage experimentation with and comparisons between
different solvers. Although MiniZinc is not perfect - no standard modelling
language will be - we believe its simplicity, expressiveness, and ease of
implementation make it a practical choice for a standard language.
