MiniZinc is a solver agnostic modeling language for defining and solver
combinatorial satisfaction and optimization problems. MiniZinc provides a
solver independent modeling language which is now supported by constraint
programming solvers, mixed integer programming solvers, SAT and SAT modulo
theory solvers, and hybrid solvers. Since 2008 we have run the MiniZinc
challenge every year, which compares and contrasts the different strengths
of different solvers and solving technologies on a set of MiniZinc models.
Here we report on what we have learnt from running the competition for 6
years.
