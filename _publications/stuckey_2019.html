Conditionals are a core concept in all programming languages.
They are also a natural and powerful mechanism for expressing complex
constraints in constraint modelling languages.
The behaviour of conditionals is complicated by undefinedness.
In this paper we show how to most effectively translate conditional constraints
for underlying solvers. We show that the simple translation into implications can be improved,
at least in terms of reasoning strength, for both constraint programming
and mixed integer programming solvers.  Unit testing shows that
the new translations are more efficient, but the benefits are
not so clear on full models
where the interaction with other features such as learning is more
complicated.
