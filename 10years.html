                    <strong>MiniZinc: Towards a standard CP modelling language</strong> was published
                    at the International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming
                    2007 in Providence, RI, USA.

                    This ten year anniversary is a great opportunity to reflect on the current state
                    and the future of the MiniZinc system &ndash; even more so since the CP conference
                    is coming to Melbourne!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We are organising a half-day workshop that is open to anyone interested in MiniZinc.
                    The workshop will include presentations on the history and discussions about the future
                    of the system. We strive for a strong workshop flavour, with ample time allocated to discussion.

                    you can talk about appliations you built with MiniZinc, what additional
                    features you would like, how you use MiniZinc in education,
                    how you connected new solvers, etc.
