MinisatID is an implementation of a search algorithm combining techniques
from the fields of SAT, SAT Module Theories, Constraint Programming and Answer Set Programming.

The algorithm consists of a core SAT-solver based on the solver Minisat, extended with propagators (in the DPLL(T) architecture) for 
+ Unfounded set computation
+ Pseudo boolean aggregates (sum, min, max, card, product)
+ QBF solving
+ Basic finite-domain constraints such as comparison, sum and product. They are handled in a lazy-clause-generation fashion, and the encoding of variables over a large domain is generated lazily.
+ Optimization: finite domain variable minimization and subset minimization

The architecture supports adding any variable or constraint on the fly, used e.g. in incremental computation.

MinisatID is developed by Broes De Cat, Bart Bogaerts and Jo Devriendt and is an integral part of the IDP knowledge-base system.
