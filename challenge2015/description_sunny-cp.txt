SUNNY-CP 2.X
=================================

Parallel CP Portfolio Solver

sunny-cp tool allows to solve a Constraint (Satisfaction/Optimization) Problem
defined in the MiniZinc language by using a portfolio approach.
It essentially implements the SUNNY algorithm described in [1][2][3].
sunny-cp is a parallel portfolio solver built on top of various state-of-the-art 
constraint solvers, including:

  Choco, Chuffed, CPX, G12/LazyFD, G12/FD, G12/Gurobi,
  G12/CBC, Gecode, HaifaCSP, iZplus, MinisatID, OR-Tools, Opturion.

In a nutshell, sunny-cp relies on two sequential steps:

  1. PRE-SOLVING: consists in the parallel execution of a static schedule and 
                  the neighborhood computation of underlying k-NN algorithm;
                  
  2. SOLVING: consists in the parallel execution of a number of predicted 
              solvers, selected by means of SUNNY algorithm.

This version is an improvement of sunny-cp 2.0 (see [6] for more details).
