Mistral is a Constraint Programming library written in C++ under the GNU General Public. 
It is hosted on github: git@github.com:ehebrard/Mistral-2.0.git. The old version is still available here: http://homepages.laas.fr/ehebrard/Software.html. 

Mistral implements most arithmetic and logic primitive constraints as well as some global constraints (AllDifferent, Linear Equalities, Element, etc...). 
Standard search strategies and heuristics are also implemented (Restarts, Weighted Degree, Activity Based Search). It is still in a very early stage of development, so it is still very basic.
