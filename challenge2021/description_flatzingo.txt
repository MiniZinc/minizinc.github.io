Flatzingo is a lazy clause learning constraint solver to handle mostly boolean and linear constraints over finite integers.
It translates the flatzinc input language into facts.
The facts plus an additional encoding are then read clingcon, an ASPmCSP system.

Clingcon is based on clingo, the ASP (Answer Set Programming) System of Potassco.
It uses lazy clause learning to introduce boolean variables and constraints during the search while doing CDNL.
Due to its origin, clingcon does only support a very limited set of global constraints but could
easily be extended.
