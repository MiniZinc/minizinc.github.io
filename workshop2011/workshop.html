<h1>The 1st International Workshop on <br/>MiniZinc (MZN&nbsp;2011)</h1>
<h3>To be held at<br/><a href="http://www.dmi.unipg.it/cp2011/">the 17th International Conference on the <br />
Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP&nbsp;2011)</a></h3>
<h3>Perugia, Italy

<br/>
Monday 12 September 2011

<p><a href="index.html">MiniZinc</a>
is a simple and expressive modelling language that is easy to
interface to different solvers. It maps models in MiniZinc down to FlatZinc
is a manner that is specializable to different underlying solvers.  It is
currently supported by constraint programming systems
<a href="http://www.gecode.org">Gecode</a>, 
<a href="http://eclipseclp.org/">Eclipse Prolog</a>, <a href="http://www.sics.se/isl/sicstuswww/site/index.html">Sicstus Prolog</a>, 
<a href="http://www.jacop.eu/">JaCoP</a>,
solvers from
the <a href="index.html">G12 group</a> including a translator to CPLEX,
the mathematical programming hybrid CP solver  
<a href="http://scip.zib.de/">SCIP</a>, 
as well as having translators that
create SAT models from FlatZinc (<a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jinbo/fzntini/">fzntini</a>), and create SMT models from
FlatZinc (<a href="http://ima.udg.edu/Recerca/ESLIP/fzn2smt/index.html">fzn2smt</a>).
<p>
MiniZinc is a leading candidate for standardizing modelling for constraint
programming, since it is the modelling language currently supported by most
systems.
<p>
The aim of this workshop is to examine the design decisions of MiniZinc and
set out the requirements for version 2.0. We wish to take input from the
whole CP community, not just solver developers. 



<!--
 Papers should be between 2
and 15 pages in LNCS format. 

<p>Workshop papers could include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature Requests: explaining some new feature for MiniZinc that would make modelling easier, more expressive, more flexible; </li>
  <li>Standardization Proposals: proposing a standard way to communicate information using MiniZinc/FlatZinc, for example, models, search, symmetry; or for controlling translation, or extending/critiquing the current draft XML standard;</li>
  <li>Discussion Papers: concentrating on an issue to do with modelling and or solving, and how this relates to the use of MiniZinc/FlatZinc.

  <li>Benchmark Proposals: describing a problem or suite of problems suitable for benchmarking CP and other optimization solvers (in MiniZinc presumably);</li>
  <li>Experience Reports: describing issues arising in supporting MiniZinc
in a new solver.
</ul>
<p>
The aim is to group papers into subjects and spend the half day workshop
having short talks and a very informal discussion framework.
We may also announce the <a href="challenge2011/challenge.html">MiniZinc Challenge 2011</a> results, if the participants are interested.
</p>

<p>The list of potential discussion topics is substantial, here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Language issues</strong>: 
do we want new features, how do they look, what will this require of FlatZinc if anything
<ul><li> Type extensions
<ul><li> enumerated types
<li>			tuples
<li>	records	
<li> 	what do we want, and how important is each one?
</ul>
<li> Recursion
<ul><li>
	should we add it?
<li>	adding it in such a way that novices do not fall over it
<li>	will this require new functions: head, tail, cons	
<li>	will we need recursive types (trees) then?
	</ul><li>	Symmetry
<ul>
		<li> 	should we have a language of symmetry declarations
		<li>	is the expression language strong enough to declare what we need?
	</ul><li>	Annotations
<ul>
		<li>	what annotations are missing, should be part of the language
		<li>	when is the treatment of annotations in flattening inadequate
			should we have "annotation classes" which flatten differently
		<li>	should we be able to annotate more parts of the model
	</ul><li>	Search
<ul>
		<li>	we know we need a richer search language, what form
		<li>	how much will FlatZinc support
		<li>	should we extend to "programmable in MiniZinc search"?
	</ul><li>	Integration
<ul>
		<li>	to be usable with other software
			for better integration
		<li>	an API for MiniZinc
		<li>	database interfaces for specifying ".dzn" ? e.g. Excel2dzn ??
	</ul><li>	Visualization
<ul>
		<li>	we have extended MiniZinc with annotations to support CP-Viz
			do other solver implementors agree this is the right way to go
			it requires solver support
		<li>	can we improve CP-Viz work better with MiniZinc?
		<li>	should we have a different approach to visualization
	</ul><li>	Integrated Development Environment
<ul>
		<li>	The G12 IDE is not very up to date, and lacks support
		<li>	do we need a new IDE, is there a quick and dirty way to create one
		<li>	what tools/features are missing
	</ul><li>	Problems with current system
<ul>
		<li>	what problems are there with the current tools
		<li>	e.g. can we do "optimization" of FlatZinc better
		<li>	how can we make the tool chain faster
	</ul><li>	Other features
<ul>
		<li>	any paper defining a feature that someone would like and why would be great
			I am sure their are plenty of things I have not thought of here
</ul></ul>
<li>		
	<strong>FlatZinc</strong>: what is missing from FlatZinc. How do we add it in a way that does not overly burden solver writers
<ul>
	<li>	Constraints
<ul>
		<li>	what is missing sinh, cosh etc?
		<li>	should we support half reified forms of constraint b => c
	</ul><li>	Runtime options
<ul>
		<li> 	we should standardize runtime option flags for FlatZinc
		<li>	what needs to be there,
	</ul><li>	Statistics
<ul>
		<li>	can we have a standard statistics output, and statistics processing to
			aid in comparing systems at a finer granularity than time
	</ul><li>	Standard
<ul>
		<li>	whats wrong with the XML FlatZinc standard
	</ul><li>	Other features
<ul>
		<li>	whats missing to make it easier for some solvers to integrate?
</ul></ul>
<li>		
	<strong>Outreach</strong>: how do we proselytise MinZinc better
<ul>
	<li>	Competition
<ul>
		<li>	how do we get more competitors
		<li>	how do we get all the people who support MiniZinc to actually enter?
	</ul><li>	Forum
<ul>
		<li>	we really need a MiniZinc forum, no-one at G12 seems expert in setting one up
			surely with modern software there is a free way of doing this simply
	</ul><li>	Problem repository
<ul>
		<li>	we tried a wiki, but found that we didn't get much activity from outside the group
			eventually we had to stop it being freely editable, as it was being vandalised repeatedly
		<li>	how do we make a repository that is 
		<ul>
			<li>	useful to solver writers as a test bench
			<li>	easy to add to and maintain
			</ul>
	</ul><li>	Tutorial
<ul>
		<li> 	how should we improve the tutorial
		<li>	should we have an open shared tutorial online
	</ul><li>	Teaching Material
<ul>
		<li>	Kim, Mark and I share a course and the material is available, can we
			gather other teaching material for MiniZinc
		<li>	What is missing?
	</ul><li>	Making it a standard
<ul>
		<li>	how do we make MiniZinc a standard (if we want to)
		<li>	should we have an XML version of MiniZinc
	</ul><li>	Governance/Directing MiniZinc
<ul>
		<li>	how do we make the development + design more community based
</ul></ul></ul>
