AB  - Within the recently proposed Universal Booleanization framework, we
      consider the CUMULATIVE constraint, for which the original Boolean
      encoding proves ineffective, and present a new Boolean encoding that
      causes the SAT solver to simulate, largely, the search strategy used by
      some of the best-performing native methods. Apart from providing
      motivation for future research in a similar direction, we obtain a
      significantly enhanced version of Universal Booleanization for problems
      containing CUMULATIVE constraints.
