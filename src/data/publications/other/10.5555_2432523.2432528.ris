AB  - System administrators increasingly use declarative, object-oriented
      languages to configure their systems. Extending such systems with
      automated analysis and decision making is an area of active research. We
      introduce ConfSolve, an object-oriented declarative configuration
      language, in which logical constraints over a system can be specified.
      Verification, impact analysis or even the generation of valid
      configurations can then be performed, by translation to a Constraint
      Satisfaction Problem (CSP), which is solved with an off-the-shelf solver.
      We present a full definition of our language and its compilation process,
      and show that our implementation outperforms previous work utilising an
      SMT solver, while adding new features such as optimisation.
