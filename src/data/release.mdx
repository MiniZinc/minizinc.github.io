- Add new builtin functions for array manipulation: `select_from_index_X`
  can slice an array with a non-contiguous set of indices, and
  `concat_index_X` can concatenate two arrays along a specified index.
- Add option type versions of bin packing and cumulatives constraints.
- Remove `bool_xor` with two arguments from the FlatZinc builtins.
  It is never output into FlatZinc by the compiler and violated the rule that
  FlatZinc builtins are not overloaded (:bugref:`913`). Also remove
  some other duplicates and incorrect overloads from `flatzinc_builtins.mzn`.
- Add includes for header files where symbols are required, in order to
  avoid issues with some compilers.
- Fix AST string allocation to avoid warnings about writing into unallocated
  memory.
- Fix float literal parsing, making it consistent across all platforms (:bugref:`941`).
- Plus 15 bugfixes!
