-  Add support for ``elseif`` in ``if then elseif endif`` expressions without an
   `else` branch.
-  Make ``sort`` functions return array of enum when input is array of
   enum (<BugRef issue={853} />).
-  Make the ``mzn_in_root_context`` function (which is used only internally and
   should not be used in user models) more flexible in where it can be called.
-  Update packaged version of the HiGHS solver to version 1.8.1.
-  Update Gurobi interface to be compatible with Gurobi 12.0.0.
-  Address compiler warnings concerning unsafe signed/unsigned comparisons and
   implicit casts between different integer types.
-  **BREAKING**: The usage of ``--compile`` (or ``-c``) flag now requires the
   user to explicitly specify the solver for which the MiniZinc instance is being
   compiled, using ``--solver``. To select the default solver (and keep the
   previous behaviour) you can use ``--solver default``.
-  Add the ``--fzn-format`` flag to influence whether the generated FlatZinc from
   ``--compile`` or ``--fzn`` is given in the traditional FlatZinc format or the
   new JSON-based format. (<BugRef issue={868} />)
-  Comments regarding the compilation invocation are now included in user-facing
   FlatZinc (``.fzn``) files, created by the ``--compile`` or ``--fzn`` flags.
-  Add ``par`` version of the ``among`` function.
-  Add support for arrays containing arrays (which only support access using
   ``par`` indices).
-  Add ``diversity.mzn`` library to be used with the diverse solutions toolchain
   included in MiniZinc Python.
-  Ensure the MiniZinc directory is added to the DLL search path when running
   child processes on Windows (<IDEBugRef issue={206} />).
-  Add ``par`` implementations for the ``arg_val`` and ``arg_val_weak`` functions.
-  Add support for calling enum constructors without arguments to return the set
   of all constructed values.
-  Deprecate and emit warning for implicit coercion of enums to integers. The
   ``enum2int`` function should be used to perform the coercion where required.
