- Variable ``in`` operators on arrays of (nested) records and tuples containing
  only enumerable (enum, int, or bool) will now be rewritten into ``table``
  global constraints.
  - Values that are ``par`` in the left hand side will be checked and filtered
    from the resulting table constraint.
- Variable ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``  and ``>=`` operators on (nested) records and
  tuples containing only enumerable (enum, int, or bool) will now be rewritten
  into ``lex_less`` or ``lex_lesseq`` global constraints.
- Automatically detect SCIP 9.0.1 and potential future versions on Windows.
- The interface to the HiGHS solver now requires version 1.7.2 or later.
- Enforce strict enum type correctness for set operations (:bugref:`828`).
- Add ``par opt`` overloads of ``min`` / ``max`` and return enum values instead
  of coercing to integers.
- Use half-reification only when there isn't a reification that is a more 
  specific match.
- Add multidimensional overloads for the ``++`` array concatenation operator.
- Plus more than 25 bug fixes.
