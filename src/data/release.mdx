-  Don't include empty stack traces in JSON stream errors or warnings
   (<BugRef issue={880}/>, <IDEBugRef issue={212}/>).
-  Wait 1 second between sending ``SIGTERM`` and ``SIGKILL`` signals to solvers
   to allow more time for cleanup (<BugRef issue={882}/>).
-  Fix a bug where calls to ``enum2int`` weren't correctly removed in
   comprehensions, leading to an internal error (<BugRef issue={879}/>).
-  Fix false-positive implicit enum coercion warnings when calling ``card`` and
   some inequality operators.
-  Fix false-positive implicit enum coercion warnings for calls with
   comprehension arguments (<BugRef issue={887}/>).
-  Recursively type check type-insts of variable declarations and function
   items.
   -  This enables enum constructors and other functions to be used on the
      left hand side of declarations, and allows overloading of functions
      with identifiers in type-insts to be correctly resolved.
-  Fix type error in flexible job shop documentation example caused by change
   of signature of ``cumulative`` to enum-safe version in 2.9.0.
-  Accept enum types for the two argument ``regular`` constraint to avoid
   false-positive warnings about implicit enum to int coercion.
-  Disallow multiple comma-separated arguments in string interpolations,
   which previously caused unexpected behaviour.
-  Fix incorrect output of non-improving solutions when using HiGHS.
-  Use scroll buttons when the tab bar overflows to ensure the side panels can
   be resized in the MiniZincIDE (<IDEBugRef issue={213}/>).
