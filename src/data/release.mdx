- Add `string_split` function that splits a string into an array of strings
  based on a separator.
- Add `json_section` annotation to mark an output item as a JSON section
  (<BugRef issue={816} />).
- Fix specification for constraint items and annotations in FlatZinc JSON.
- Fix flattening of negated let expressions with constraints.
- Fix crash when equating identifiers to tuples/records in if-then-else
  expressions.
- Fix `string_length` function to return the number of Unicode code points
  rather than the number of bytes (i.e., to interpret the string as UTF-8).
- Emit type error for opt tuples and records created through type aliases.
- Fix evaluation of par partial functions returning arrays.
- Fix type inference for if-then-else expressions with different tuple or
  record types in the branches.
- Fix evaluation error caused by removal of fixed FlatZinc variables without
  fixing them in the output model.
- Fix computed type when flattening cv comprehensions containing tuple or
  record types.
- Fix unsatisfiability caused by reification in negated boolean context
  (<BugRef issue={813} />).
- Fix bug in computation of common type of incompatible record types.
- Fix crash when type checking nested arrays of tuples or records.
- Fix incorrect unification of flattened tuple/record fields with paths
  enabled.
