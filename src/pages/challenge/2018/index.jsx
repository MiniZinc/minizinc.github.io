            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              The aim of the challenge is to start to compare various constraint
              solving technology on the same problems sets. The focus is on
              finite domain propagation solvers. An auxiliary aim is to build up
              a library of interesting problem models, which can be used to
              compare solvers and solving technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Entrants to the challenge provide a FlatZinc or MiniZinc solver
              and global constraint definitions specialized for their solver.
              Each solver is run on 100 MiniZinc model instances. For FlatZinc
              solvers, we run the translator <tt>mzn2fzn</tt> on the MiniZinc
              model and instance using the provided global constraint
              definitions to create a FlatZinc file. The FlatZinc file is input
              to the provided FlatZinc solver. For MiniZinc solvers, the
              MiniZinc model and instance are input to the provided solver.
              Points are awarded for solving problems, speed of solution, and
              goodness of solutions (for optimization problems).

            <p>
              This is the tenth time this challenge is run, and there are many
              possibilities for comparing CP solvers. The rules try to make a
              sensible set of choices for the comparison. We would welcome any
              comments or suggestions regarding the running of this challenge.
