## MiniZinc Challenge {year} - Rules

<Breadcrumbs

    `Rules`,

These are the official rules for the MiniZinc Challenge {year}. Version 1.2.
These rules were last updated on 26 May {year}.

### Solver submission

The MiniZinc Challenge {year} will test solvers on problems written in MiniZinc {challenge.minizinc}.

A _participant_ is a person or entity (usually a solver developer) who has notified the challenge
organisers of their intent to enter one or more solvers in the challenge. This must be done prior to
the final submission date in order for any solver entries to be considered.

An _entry_ is a constraint solver that is installed in a Docker image that uses the MiniZinc
Challenge {year} image (as provided by the organisers) as its base.  
Constraint solvers that have several variants (for example that can alternatively use copying or
trailing, or learning and non-learning solvers), may submit one entry per variant, although the
organisers reserve the right to reject such variations if they are not sufficiently interesting,
(e.g. multiple copies of the same solver with differing parameters).

Before the final submission date, participants must complete an online form (which will be made
available to participants before the initial submission round, or, as soon as possible after
notification of registration, whichever is later) for each prospective entry.  
If this is done before the end of the initial submission round, feedback will be given on the
entry with respect to rules conformance and performance. This does not affect the final scoring.  
Participants may amend, or add additional entries freely until the final submission date.

The form will collect the following information:

1.  Which competition CLASS(ES) the entry will compete in (see

    <Link href={`/challenge/${year}/rules#competition-classes`}>below</Link>
    for details).

2.  A short (1-2 pages) description of the system. This
    should include a list of all authors of the system and their present institutional affiliations.
    It should also describe any algorithms or data structures that are not standardly used in such
    systems.  
    System descriptions will be posted alongside the competition results.

3.  Whether the entry may be used by 3rd parties (entities that are not the submitters nor the
    MiniZinc Challenge organisers) for research purposes.

4.  The repository and tag name for the entry on Docker Hub.

The organisers will test each entry to ensure conformance with the rules, and if conformant, the
entry will be run in the challenge, where it will be given a score according to the

<Link href={`/challenge/${year}/rules#assessment`}>assessment procedure</Link>.
If the entry does not conform with the rules, or is otherwise unable to run
successfully, the Challenge organisers will make a reasonable attempt to contact
the participant and notify them so that the issues can be remedied.
Nevertheless, the organisers reserve the right to reject an entry if its process
proves overly difficult. If an entry requires modification after the final
submission date in order to be run in the challenge, the entry may be run at the
organisers' discretion, and disqualified from being awarded prizes.

The results will be announced at <Link href={`https://cp${year}.a4cp.org`}>CP{year}</Link>.
Participants are encouraged to attend CP{year}, but are not required to in order to enter or win.

#### Competition classes

There will be at most five competition CLASSES depending on how many solvers are entered in each of
them:

- <dfn>FD search</dfn>: solvers in this class must follow the search strategy
  defined in the problem. They will be disqualified if there is evidence that
  they do not follow the search strategy.
- <dfn>Free search</dfn>: solvers in this class are free to ignore the search
  strategy. All FD search solvers (and local search solver running on a single
  thread) will be automatically entered in this class too.
- <dfn>Parallel search</dfn>: solvers in this class are free to use multiple
  threads or cores to solve the problem. All entries in the free search class
  (and the local search class) will be automatically entered in this class too,
  but they will be run in a single threaded mode.
- <dfn>Open class</dfn>: This class allows the usage of portfolio solvers.
  Solvers in this class are free to use multiple threads or cores to solve the
  problem. All entries in the parallel search class will be automatically
  entered in this class too.
- <dfn>Local search</dfn>: This class is specific for the local search solvers.
  Solvers in this class are free to use multiple threads or cores to solve the
  problem.

#### Docker images

A challenge entry Docker image must use the MiniZinc Challenge {year} image (as provided by the
organisers) as its base. The image must be set up such that the default minizinc solver is the
entry's solver. The entry will be run by executing the `minizinc` command using the default
solver for the image with options depending on the entry CLASS.

- FD: `minizinc -i --output-mode dzn --output-objective <model.dzn> [data.dzn]`
- FREE: `minizinc -i --output-mode dzn --output-objective -f <model.dzn> [data.dzn]`
- PAR: `minizinc -i --output-mode dzn --output-objective -p 4 <model.dzn> [data.dzn]`

FlatZinc solvers must accept the following <Link href={documentation("fzn-spec.html#command-line-interface-and-standard-options", challenge.minizinc)}>standard options</Link>, and they must be included in the supported
`stdFlags` of the <Link href={documentation("fzn-spec.html#sec-cmdline-conffiles", challenge.minizinc)}>solver configuration</Link>:

- One or more of:

  - `-a` (output all solutions/intermediate solutions), or
  - `-i` (output intermediate solutions).

  One of these options (depending on which appears in the `stdFlags` for the solver) will be given
  for all optimisation problems (but not for satisfaction problems).

  Solvers are free to simply always output intermediate solutions for optimisation problems, and
  a single solution for satisfaction problems (or whatever is supported by the solver). However,
  they must still accept one of these flags.

- `-f` (ignore given search strategy).  
  Entries competing in the `FREE` class are free to always ignore the search strategy, however they must still
  accept the `-f` flag.

- `-p <n>` (use the specified number `n` of threads and/or cores).  
  Entries competing in the `PAR` and `OPEN` classes must accept the `-p` flag.

MiniZinc solvers must support the following <Link href={documentation("command_line.html#options", challenge.minizinc)}>options</Link>
(by placing them in the solver configuration `stdFlags` or in `extraFlags` for long-form options):

- `--output-mode dzn`  
  Output solutions (assignments to variables annotated with `output`) in DZN format.
  This option **must** be supported by the solver.
- `--output-objective`  
  Output the objective value as `_objective` for optimisation problems.
  This option **must** be supported by the solver.
- `-f` (ignore given search strategy)  
  Entries competing in the `FREE` class are free to always ignore the search strategy, however they
  must still accept the `-f` flag.
- `-p <n>` (use the specified number `n` of threads and/or cores).  
  Entries competing in the `PAR` and `OPEN` classes must accept the `-p` flag.

Execution of solvers must not require running Docker with `--privileged`.

More details about Docker images and how to create a Docker image with your solver is available

<Link href={`/challenge/${year}/docker`}>here</Link>.

#### Output requirements

Output from FlatZinc solver entries must conform to the <Link href={documentation("fzn-spec.html#output", challenge.minizinc)}>FlatZinc specification for MiniZinc {challenge.minizinc}</Link>.

MiniZinc solver entries must correctly implement the `--output-mode dzn` and `--output-objective`
options (that is, output must exactly match the format that MiniZinc itself would output given
these options).

For optimization problems, if the time limit is exceeded before the final solution is printed then
the last complete approximate solution printed will be considered to be the solution for that entry.
Note that is important that entries flush the output stream after printing each approximate solution
so that timing information is accurate.

#### Execution Environment

During the MiniZinc Challenge {year} all instances of Docker images will run on a compute server with
the following specification:

- Image Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
- Processor(s): Intel Xeon® Platinum 8260
- Configuration for FD, FREE: 1 core, 16 GiB memory
- Configuration for PAR, OPEN: 8 cores, 64 GiB memory

Except in the Parallel search, Open class, and local search solver using multiple cores, only a
single core of one processor will be used for each entry.

Note that during testing of submissions, solvers may be run with a different core/memory
configuration. The environment variables `NUM_CPUS` and `MEMORY_LIMIT` will be made available to
submission containers giving the number of cores and the memory limit in MiB respectively (these
will be present during testing and when running the Challenge).

### Benchmark Problem Specification

Solver entries will be run with models that are compatible with <Link href={documentation("", challenge.minizinc)}>MiniZinc {challenge.minizinc}</Link>.
These models will adhere to the following restrictions:

1.  Models may only use following types of variables:

    - integer (e.g. `var 1..10: x`),  
      optional integer (e.g. `var opt 1..10: x`),  
      integer set (e.g. `var set of 1..10: x`)
    - boolean (e.g. `var bool: x`),  
      optional boolean (e.g. `var opt bool: x`)
    - enumerated type (e.g. `var MY_ENUM: x`),  
      optional enumerated type (e.g. `var opt MY_ENUM: x`),  
      set of enumerated type (e.g. `var set of MY_ENUM: x`)  
      (including use of enum constructors in enum type definitions)
    - arrays of the above types of variables

    In particular, float variables are **not permitted**.

2.  In order to facilitate local search entries, ideally a model should wrap symmetry breaking
    constraints in a predicate "symmetry_breaking_constraint" e.g.,

    ```
    var 0..100: x :: output;
    var 0..100: y :: output;
    constraint x + y < 144;
    constraint symmetry_breaking_constraint(x <= y);
    ```

    and redundant constraints in a predicate "redundant_constraint", e.g.,

    ```
    array[1..4] of var 0..20: start :: output;
    array[1..4] of int: duration = [3, 4, 6, 7];
    array[1..4] of int: usage    = [6, 3, 5, 3];
    constraint cumulative(start, duration, usage, 10);
    constraint redundant_constraint(start[1] + dur[1] <= start[3] \/ start[3] + dur[3] <= start[1]);
    ```

3.  Each solve item must be annotated with a search strategy, such that fixing all the variables
    appearing in the search strategy would allow a value propagation solver to check a solution.
    For example,

    ```
    var 1..5: x :: output;
    var 1..5: y :: output;
    var 1..5: z :: output;
    constraint x <= y /\ y <= z;
    solve :: int_search([x, y, z], input_order, indomain_min, complete)
             satisfy;
    ```

    is correct but not

    ```
    solve :: int_search([x,z], input_order, indomain_min, complete)
             satisfy;
    ```

    even though most FD solvers would know the second was satisfiable.

4.  Search annotations will be restricted to **bool_search**, **int_search**, **set_search** and
    **seq_search**.  
    For **bool_search** and **int_search**, only the following parameters (where applicable) will be
    used:

    - variable choice:
      - input_order
      - first_fail (variable with smallest domain size)
      - anti_first_fail (variable with largest domain size)
      - smallest (variable with smallest minimal value)
      - largest (variable with largest maximum value)
    - value choice: \[examples for domain \{1,3,4,18\}\]
      - indomain_min (x &lt;= 1; x > 1)
      - indomain_max (x >= 18; x < 18)
      - indomain_median (x = 3 ; x != 3)
      - indomain_split (x &lt;= (1+18)/2 ; x > (1+18)/2)
      - indomain_reverse_split (x > (1+18)/2 ; x &lt;= (1+18)/2)
    - search style
      - complete

    For **set_search**, only the following parameters will be used:

    - variable choice:
      - input_order
    - value choice:
      - indomain_min
      - indomain_max
    - search style
      - complete

    Note that for variable choices ties are broken by taking the earliest variable in the given
    array. Also note that the decision is reassessed at each choice.

    ```
    var 1..5: x :: output;
    var 1..10: objective :: output;
    constraint x > 1 -> objective > 7;
    constraint x = 1 -> objective < 3;
    solve :: int_search([x, objective], first_fail, indomain_min, complete)
             maximize objective;
    ```

    will first label `x = 1` and find maximum value `objective = 2` eventually on backtracking to
    the choice `x = 1`, then setting `x >= 2` in most FD solvers will have domains for `x :: 2..5`
    and `objective :: 8..10` and this time `objective` will be selected as the next variable to
    label. A full specification of the available choices is given in the <Link href={documentation("fzn-spec.html#search-annotations", challenge.minizinc)}>FlatZinc specification for MiniZinc {challenge.minizinc}</Link>.

5.  All variables appearing in the search strategy (that is, variables where if all fixed, would
    allow a propagation solver to check a solution) must be annotated with `output` (or must not
    have a right-hand side).

    ```
    var 1..10: x :: output;
    var int: y = x div 2;
    var 1..3: z :: output;
    constraint y * z = 2;
    solve :: int_search([x, z], input_order, indomain_min, complete)
             satisfy;
    ```

    This ensures that we are able to check for the correctness of solutions generated by solvers by
    using the options `--output-mode dzn` and `--output-objective` when running the instance, then
    passing the result to a value propagation solver with the original instance.

### Benchmark Selection

The benchmarks for MiniZinc Challenge {year} will be selected by the judges to try to examine some of
the breadth of characteristics of FD solvers:

- propagation speed
- search speed
- global constraints
- satisfaction
- optimization

To obtain benchmarks of suitable difficulty we will select only such instances that can be solved by
at least one of the participating solvers in a sensible time-frame. For the qualification rounds no
such restriction applies.

In order to collect good benchmarks each participant is <span className="text-red-600">strongly encouraged</span> to submit one or two MiniZinc
models, making use of only the global constraints included in the MiniZinc {challenge.minizinc}
library, as well as some (preferably 10 or more) instance files for each model. The
instances should range from easy (about a minute) to hard (about 15 minutes) if possible.
In addition, the submitter should provide one "toy" instance for testing purposes.{' '}

Note that the model must conform to the problem format restrictions above, and the
Challenge organisers may make changes to the submitted problems to make them
suitable for use in the Challenge.

Submitted problem must be placed under the
[MIT licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and each model and data file must begin with a
comment which includes the licence, unless otherwise agreed to by the submitter and the challenge
organisers.

### Submissions

When solver submissions open, participants will be able to submit their Docker image and get
automated feedback on compatibility with the competition hardware, compliance with these rules, and
any other matters that may arise. Feedback is provided through an automated test suite, and is
subject to a usage quota to prevent abuse of the system.

Participants may update their submission as often as they like until the submission deadline, at
which point their latest submission will be taken as their entry to the Challenge. Only entries
which pass the automated checks will be entered into the Challenge, except at the discretion of the
Challenge organisers.

**NOTE** that passing the automated test suite does not guarantee eligibility for the Challenge.
If there is evidence that the submission does not conform to these rules, the entry may be
disqualified even if it passes the automated tests.

### The Challenge

The challenge will require solvers to process 100 MiniZinc instances with a run-time limit of 20
minutes (process time) per instances.  
**NOTE** that the MiniZinc to FlatZinc time will be included in this time.

### Assessment

Each solver _s_ is run on problem _p_ and the following information is collected.

- _timeUsed(p,s)_ - the _wall clock_ time used by the solver, or _timeLimit(p)_ if it was still
  running at the timeLimit (quantized to seconds by rounding towards zero).
- _solved(p,s)_ - true if a correct solution is returned, or correct unsatisfiability is detected
- _quality(p,s)_ - the objective value of the best solution found by the solver (that is the last
  solution fully output before the time limit) assuming maximization
- _optimal(p,s)_ - whether the objective value is proved optimal by the solver.
- _timeSol(p,s,i)_ - the _wall clock_ time used by the solver for finding the _i_-th solution on
  the problem
- _qualitySol(p,s,i)_ - the objective value of the _i_-th solution found by the solver on the
  problem

There three different scoring procedure: **complete**, **incomplete**, and **area**. For prizes, the
**complete** solver ranking is used.

#### Complete Scoring Procedure

The complete scoring procedure is based on the
[Borda count](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) voting system. Each benchmark instance is
treated like a voter who ranks the solvers. Each solver scores points equal to the number of solvers
that they beat in the ranking (more or less). A solver _s_ scores points on problem _p_ by comparing
its performance with each other solver _s'_ on problem _p_.

- If _s_ gives a better answer than _s'_ it scores 1 point.
- If _s_ and _s'_ gives indistinguishable answers then scoring is based on execution time
  comparison (see below).
- If _s_ gives a worse answer than _s'_ it scores 0 points.

In the case of indistinguishable answers between _s_ and _s'_, _s_ scores
_timeUsed(p,s') / (timeUsed(p,s') + timeUsed(p,s))_ , 0.5 if both finished in 0s.
The exception is that if _solved(p,s)_ is false, that is, _s_ fails to find any solution or prove
unsatisfiability for problem _p_ it always scores 0 points (even if _s'_ also similarly fails).

- **Satisfaction Problem**  
  A solver _s_ answer is **better** than solver _s'_ answer on satisfaction problem _p_ iff
  - _solved(p,s) ∧ not solved(p,s')_
- **Optimization Problem**  
  A solver _s_ is **better** than solver _s'_ on optimization problem _p_ iff
  - _solved(p,s) ∧ not solved(p,s')_, or
  - _optimal(p,s) ∧ not optimal(p,s')_, or
  - _quality(p,s) > quality(p,s')_

#### Incomplete Scoring Procedure

The incomplete scoring procedure is the same as the complete one using the Borda count, but the
proved optimal solution by a solver does not count.

- **Satisfaction Problem**  
  A solver _s_ answer is **better** than solver _s'_ answer on satisfaction problem _p_ iff
  - _solved(p,s) ∧ not solved(p,s')_
- **Optimization Problem**  
  A solver _s_ is **better** than solver _s'_ on optimization problem _p_ iff
  - _solved(p,s) ∧ not solved(p,s')_, or
  - _quality(p,s) > quality(p,s')_

Indistinguishable answers are treated the same as in the complete scoring procedure for satisfaction
problems. For optimization problems, _s_ scores 0.5 irrespective of _timeUsed_ unless _solved(p,s)_
is false, in which case it scores 0 points.

#### Area Scoring Procedure

The area scoring procedure computes the integral of a step function over the runtime horizon.
Intuitively, a solver that quickly finds good solutions performs better than a solver that finds
even better solutions, but much later in the solving stage. The step function _f_ is defined as
follows for a problem _p_ and a solver _s_.

- **Satisfaction and Unsatisfiable Problems**  
  _f(p,s) = timeUsed(p,s)_
- **Satisfiable Minimization Problems**  
  _f(p,s) = 0.25 * timeSol(p,s,1) + 0.5 * sum(i in 1..n)(qualitySol(p,s,i-1) * (timeSol(p,s,i) -
  timeSol(p,s,i-1)) ) / (UB - LB + 1) + 0.25 * timeUsed(p,s)_  
  where _UB = max(s in Solvers)(qualitySol(p,s,1))_ and _LB = min(s in Solvers)(quality(p,s)_.

#### Classes

The scoring calculations will be done once for each run class: FD search, Free search, Parallel
search, Open class, and Local search. Note that if too few solvers are entered in a class then the
challenge won't be run for that class.

The organizers may well run entries in the FD search class on a series of smaller problems to test
that they indeed are following the given search strategy. These problems will not accrue points, but
may disqualify an entry from the FD search class.

### Prizes

The solvers will be ranked on total points awarded. There will be prizes for the solvers with the
highest scores in each of the run classes: FD search, Free search, Parallel search, Open class, and
Local search. The organizers may also award prizes to the best solvers on a particular category of
problems. Note that if too few solvers are entered in a class then the challenge won't be run for
that class and no prizes will be awarded for that class.

### Restrictions

The organizers reserve the right to enter their own systems — or other systems of interest — to the
competition, however these will not be eligible for prizes, but still will modify the scoring
results.
In addition, the organizers reserve the right not to run the challenge on classes with an
insufficient number of solver entries.
