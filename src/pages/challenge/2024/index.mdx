## MiniZinc Challenge {year}

<Breadcrumbs
  className="not-prose"
  items={[['MiniZinc Challenge', '/challenge'], `Challenge ${year}`]}

### The Challenge

The aim of the challenge is to compare various constraint solving technology on the same problems
sets. The focus is on finite domain propagation solvers. An auxiliary aim is to build up a library
of interesting problem models, which can be used to compare solvers and solving technologies.

Challenge participants provide a FlatZinc or MiniZinc solver and global constraint definitions
specialized for their solver. Each solver is run on 100 MiniZinc model instances. For FlatZinc
solvers, we run the `minizinc` compiler on the MiniZinc model and instance using the provided global
constraint definitions to create a FlatZinc file. The resultant FlatZinc file is then given as input
to the provided FlatZinc solver. For MiniZinc solvers, the MiniZinc model and data are input to the
provided solver. Points are awarded for solving problems, speed of solution, and goodness of
solutions (for optimization problems).

### Registration

Entrants must register their intention to enter the contest _before_ the final submission date.

To register, use the [MiniZinc Challenge Submission System](https://challenge.minizinc.org).

### Submission

All entrants need to extend the MiniZinc Docker image (available at <Link href={`https://hub.docker.com/r/minizinc/mznc${year}/`}>{`https://hub.docker.com/r/minizinc/mznc${year}/`}</Link>, tag
`latest`) with their solver. Detailed information how to prepare the Docker image are available <Link href={`/challenge/${year}/docker`}>here</Link>.
The entrant will upload the extended image to Docker Hub and fill out a web form (provided after registration) providing the location of the image to the MiniZinc organisers.

Please carefully read <Link href={`/challenge/${year}/rules`}>the rules</Link> before submission.

### Problem Submission

We strongly encourage all entrants to submit one or two MiniZinc models satisfying the contest
requirements, together with instances for these models. All models will be considered for the
MiniZinc Challenge, however we may need to make some modifications to them in order to ensure they
are suitable for the challenge.

The sooner they are submitted the better, the deadline is **{challenge.problemSubmissionDeadline}**. The call for problem
submission is available <Link href={`/challenge/${year}/call_for_problems`}>here</Link>. Please feel free to distribute it.

### Rules

The rules for the MiniZinc Challenge {year} are available <Link href={`/challenge/${year}/rules`}>here</Link>.  
If we need to make changes to the rules, all registered entrants will be informed by email.

### Judges

The judges will be responsible for selecting the tested instances, vetting the results, and ruling
on any questions that arise during the competition.

- Jimmy H.M. Lee. Chinese University of Hong Kong.
- Barry O'Sullivan, University College Cork, Ireland.
- Roland Yap, National University of Singapore.

### Feedback

This is the 15th time this challenge is being run, and there are many possibilities for comparing CP
solvers. The rules try to make a sensible set of choices for the comparison. We welcome any comments
or suggestions regarding the running of this challenge.

We can be contacted at `challenge` [at] `minizinc.dev`.
