Gecoxicals

This solver is based on Gecode 4.2.0 and is identical to the Gecode
entry in all points but one. The only difference is that all the
handmade propagators have been removed and replaced by propagators
compiled from indexicals. Propagators have been generated for all
flatzinc predicates and for some but not all minizinc global
constraints (the other ones use the decompositions of the standard
minizinc library).

Indexicals are formulas of the form "X in sigma", meaning that the
domain of variable X must be restricted to be included in the set
sigma. Sigma usually depends on the current domains of other
variables. Indexicals are a convenient and solver-independant way to
specify propagation for a broad class of constraints. More information
about the indexical compiler can be found at
