Opturion CPX -- MiniZinc Challenge 2013
=======================================

Opturion CPX is a constraint solver for discrete optimisation or satisfaction
problems developed by Opturion Pty Ltd.  It is based on the CPX solver
originally developed as part of the G12 project at NICTA.

Opturion CPX uses the lazy clause generation technique, which combines both CP
and SAT solving techniques.  By using this approach CPX can provide state of
the art solutions to a number of hard combinatorial problems.  Like CP, CPX
allows a problem to be mapped to a compact representation, rather than
generating a SAT representation (which can become huge, especially when dealing
with integer variables and constraints). Like SAT, it learns from failure and
can automatically focus the search on the ``bottlenecks'' of a problem. An
important feature of CPX is that it only generates propositional variables
needed for search, so large variable domains do not necessarily slow down the
search or proof of optimality.

CPX's default search selects variables according to a combination of domain
size and activity count.  It bisects the domain of the selected variables.  The
default search uses Luby-style restarts.  For optimization problems, the
default search is preceded by a probing phase in which random probes of the
search tree are used to initialise the variable activity counts.
