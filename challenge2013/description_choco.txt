Choco3 is a java library for constraint satisfaction problems and constraint optimization problems. 
This solver already has a long history and has been fully re-engineered this year, to a 3.0 version. 

The Choco3 library contains numerous variables, constraints and search procedures, to provide wide modeling perspectives.
Most common variables are integer variables (including binary variables and views) but the distribution also includes set variables, graph variables and real variables. 
The constraint library provided by Choco3 contains many global constraints, which gives a very expressive modeling language.
The search process can also be greatly improved by various built-in search strategies (such as DomWDeg, ABS, IBS, first-fail, etc.) and some optimization procedures (LNS, fast restart, etc.).
Moreover, Choco3 natively supports explained constraints.
Last, several useful extra features, such as a FlatZinc (the target language of MiniZinc) parser and some viewing tools, are provided as well.

Choco3 is used by the academy for teaching and research and by the industry to solve real-world problems, such as program verification, smart grid management, timetabling, scheduling and routing.

Main authors of Choco3 are Charles Prud'homme and Jean-Guillaume Fages (Ecole des Mines de Nantes, France).
