<h1>Call for Problem Submission for the MiniZinc Challenge 2014</h1>

<p>
The MiniZinc Challenge is an annual solver competition in the 
Constraint Programming (CP) community held before the International 
Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming. 
The MiniZinc Challenge 2014 is seeking interesting problem sets on 
which various constraint solving technologies should be compared on 
this year. Everyone is allowed to submit problems regardless of 
whether they are an entrant in the challenge.
<p>

<h2>Important dates and deadlines:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Problem submission open: now
<li>Problem submission deadline:  <strong>Fri, 6 June 2014</strong>
</ul>

<h2>Problem submission</h2>
<ul>
<li>Send an email with the subject line “[MZNC14] benchmark” to mzn-challenge 'at' minizinc.org
</ul>

<p>
There are no restrictions on the kind of problems, but ideally they 
should be of interesting nature such as practice-related problems and 
puzzles etc. Problem submissions with real-world instances are welcome 
warmly. Models for the 2014 challenge can only use integer and Boolean 
variables.

<p>
The problem submitter provides a MiniZinc model of the problem and 
20 instances ranging from easy-to-solve to hard-to-solve for an 
“ordinary” CP system. It is strongly encouraged to make use of the 
global constraint definitions provided in the MiniZinc 1.6 distribution. 
Please, follow the links below for submission instructions and requirements.
