=====================================================================<br>

<p>
The aim of the MiniZinc Challenge is to start to compare various constraint
solving technology on the same problems sets. The focus is on finite domain
propagation solvers. An auxiliary aim is to build up a library of
interesting problem models, which can be used to compare solvers and solving
technologies.
</p>
<p>
Entrants to the challenge provide a FlatZinc solver and global constraint
definitions specialized for their solver. Each solver is run on 100 MiniZinc
model instances. We run either (A) the translator mzn2fzn on the MiniZinc model 
and instance using the provided global constraint definitions to create a
FlatZinc file, which is taken as input to the provided solver or (B) the provided
solver directly on MiniZinc model and instance. Points are
awarded for solving problems, speed of solution, and goodness of solutions
(for optimization problems).
