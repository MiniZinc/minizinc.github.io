title: MiniZinc - Challenge 2020 - Call for Problem Submission
---

<h2>Call for Problem Submission for the MiniZinc Challenge 2020</h2>

<p>
The MiniZinc Challenge is an annual solver competition in the 
Constraint Programming (CP) community held before the International 
Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming. 
The MiniZinc Challenge 2020 is seeking interesting problem sets on 
which various constraint solving technologies should be compared on 
this year. Everyone is allowed to submit problems regardless of 
whether they are an entrant in the challenge.
<p>

<h3>Important dates and deadlines:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Problem submission open: now
<li>Problem submission deadline: Fri, 24 July 2020
</ul>

<h3>Problem submission</h3>
<ul>
<li>Send an email with the subject line “[MZNC20] benchmark” to mzn-challenge 'at' lists.csiro.au
</ul>

<p>
There are no restrictions on the kind of problems, but ideally they 
should be of interesting nature such as practice-related problems and 
puzzles etc. Problem submissions with real-world instances are particulary 
welcome.
Models for the 2020 challenge can only use integer and Boolean 
variables.

<p>
As in the previous years, we anticipate local search entrants in this years 
challenge again. Ideally a MiniZinc model should wrap symmetry breaking 
constraints in a predicate "symmetry_breaking_constraint" defined as
<pre>
predicate symmetry_breaking_constraint(var bool: c) = c;
</pre>
and wrap redundant constraints in a predicate "redundant_constraint" defined similarly as
<pre>
predicate redundant_constraint(var bool: c) = c;
</pre>
The aim of this wrapping is that local search solvers can "turn off" symmetry 
breaking and redundant constraints, in order to improve solving.


<p>
The problem submitter provides a MiniZinc model of the problem and 
at least 20 instances ranging from easy-to-solve to hard-to-solve for an 
“ordinary” CP system. In addition, there should be at least one "toy" instance
for testing purposes. It is strongly encouraged to make use of the 
global constraint definitions provided in the MiniZinc 2.4 distribution. 
If you have an instance generator, we are more than happy to receive it.
Please, follow the links below for submission instructions and requirements.
