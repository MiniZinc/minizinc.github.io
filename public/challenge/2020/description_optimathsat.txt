===============================================================================

OptiMathSAT is a state-of-the-art Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) solver
based on the SMT solver MathSAT5 (http://mathsat.fbk.eu/). OptiMathSAT features
both single- and multi-objective optimization over arbitrary sets of Linear
Rational Arithmetic (LRA), Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA), Linear Integer and
Rational Arithmetic (LIRA), Bit-Vectors (BV), Floating-Point (FP),
Pseudo-Boolean (PB) and MaxSMT cost functions. Multiple objective functions
can be combined with one another into a Lexicographic or a Pareto optimization
problem, or independently solved in a single run (for the best efficiency).

Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is the problem of deciding the
satisfiability of a first-order formula with respect to a combination of
decidable first-order theories. Typical theories of SMT interest are (the
theory of) linear arithmetic over the rationals (LRA), the integers (LIA)
or their combination (LIRA), non-linear arithmetic over the rationals (NLRA)
or the integers (NLIA), arrays (AR), bit-vectors (BV), floating-point
arithmetic (FP), and their combination thereof. The last two decades have
witnessed the development of very efficient SMT solvers based on the so-called
lazy-SMT schema. 

Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) is an extension to Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) that allows for finding a model of a first-order formula that
is optimal with respect to some objective function expressed in some background
theory, by means of a combination of SMT and optimization procedures. 



Distinctive Features:

1. Multi-Objective optimization


    OptiMathSAT extends the FlatZinc with Multi-Objective optimization, e.g.

        solve minimize cost, maximize revenue;

    Multiple objectives are combined together using the strategy specified by
    the option '-opt.priority=[box|lex|par]', that is:

    - par: performs a classic Pareto-front exploration
    - lex: optimizes the objectives in lexicographic order
    - box: optimizes each objective independently from the others

2. Infinite-Precision Arithmetic: every arithmetical operation is performed
   with an infinite precision arithmetic library (e.g. GMP) to ensure the
   correctness of the result with absolute precision. Unbounded variables are
   assumed to have an infinite domain ]-INF, +INF[.


3. OptiMathSAT can be used as a FZN2OMT interface to other OMT solvers like
   Z3 (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) and Barcelogic (https://barcelogic.com/).
