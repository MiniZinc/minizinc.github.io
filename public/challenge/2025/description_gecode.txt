The Gecode entry to the MiniZinc challenge 2025

This solver is based on the Gecode C++ constraint solving library
(upcoming version 6.3.0 + some modifications), and the Gecode/FlatZinc
interface. Both Gecode and Gecode/FlatZinc are available under the MIT
license from the web site http://www.gecode.org.

The par version of this entry uses a mix of search strategies:
 - the strategy specified in the model
 - a dynamic strategy (based on AFC, aka dom_w_deg) with restarts
 - an LNS strategy to generate solutions quickly (only for optimisation problems)
