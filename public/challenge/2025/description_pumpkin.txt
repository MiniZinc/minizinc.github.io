Pumpkin is a new combinatorial optimisation solver that is under active development at the ConSol Lab at TU Delft.
It is developed at TU Delft by (in alphabetical order): Emir Demirović, Maarten Flippo, Imko Marijnissen, and Konstantin Sidorov.

Other contributors:
- Robbin Baauw
- Tip ten Brink
- Jeff Smits

Pumpkin has a FlatZinc frontend, but can also be used to solve SAT and MaxSAT problems. Support for CPMpy and XCSP is planned for the near future.
The solver is written in pure Rust and also exposes a Rust API which allows users to express models with predefined constraints and implement custom branching strategies.

The solver is based on the (lazy clause generation) constraint programming paradigm, and has an architecture that does not explicitly reify atomic constraints to SAT literals. This allows creating arbitrary atomic constraints at any time without creating literals for them up-front. Feature-wise, it supports integer variables, the FlatZinc built-in constraints for integer and boolean variables, and the cumulative global constraint. 

A unique feature of Pumpkin is that it can produce a certificate of unsatisfiability as part of the solving process without significant overhead. See our CP’24 [1] paper for more details.
