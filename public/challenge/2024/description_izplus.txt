* What is iZplus

  iZplus is a FlatZinc solver using iZ-C constraint programming
library which is developed by NTT DATA SEKISUI SYSTEMS CORPORATION.

iZ-C provides :
  * many built-in constraints
  * constraint propagation mechanism
  * simple search strategy

And in iZplus, following algorithms are 'plus'ed.
  * Randomized restarting in search
  * Local search for optimization problem
  * Local search for satisfying problem
  * Variable reordering
  * NG learning
