Elsie Geas - Another Lazy Clause Generation Solver

What's with the name?

Well, it's an LCG solver. An Ell-Cee-Gee solver. Yeah, that's all it is.
That, and the drive to implement it does have an air of compulsion to it.

Why another solver?

The compulsion to build solvers seems to be a bit of an occupational sickness.

But mostly to play around with different implementation ideas.
Geas is intended to be readily extensible (with new variable types as well as propagators),
can cope with large variable domains, and can spawn multiple solver instances in the same process.
