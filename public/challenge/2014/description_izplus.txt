* What is fzn_izplus

  fzn_izplus is a FlatZinc solver using iZ-C constraint programming
library which is developed by NTT DATA SEKISUI SYSTEMS CORPORATION.

iZ-C provides :
  * many built-in constraints
  * constraint propagation mechanism
  * simple search strategy

And in fzn_izplus, following algorithms are 'plus'ed.

  * Randomized restarting in search
    For fast random number generation, Xorshift128 algorithm is used.
       http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper

  * Local search for optimization problem
      In real world problems, sometimes finding 'good' solution using
    short time is more important than finding 'best' solution using
    long time. And it is known empirically that 'good' solutions are
    similar to each other, then local search can be a good strategy.
    
      For optimization problem, fzn_izplus tries to find first solution
    using constraint propagation and search. After one solution was found,
    it searches similar solutions better than first one.

  * Local search for satisfying problem
      In parallel mode, one thread is used for local search.
      (Maxmizing count of assinged variables without conflict)

      In single thread mode, two strategies (local and normal search) are
      used alternately.

  * Variable reordering
      Failures occured while searching are recorded and variable selection
     order is changed using this information.

  * NG learning
      NG learning is implemented as described in:
        http://ijcai.org/papers07/Papers/IJCAI07-019.pdf

      (To keep NG set small, inactive NGs are removed from learnt set.)
