Mistral-2.0 is a C++ library under the GNU General Public License and is hosted on github: git@github.com:ehebrard/Mistral-2.0.git.
It implements most arithmetic and logic primitive constraints as well as some global constraints (AllDifferent, Linear Equalities, Element, etc...). Standard search strategies and heuristics are also implemented (Restarts, Weighted Degree, Activity Based Search). However, it is still in an early stage of development.
