This is "fzn-oscar-cbls", a MiniZinc backend using the Oscar/CBLS
solver. It solves problems by using constraint-based local search in
an adapative tabu search setting. Before running the search, the
backend looks for one-way constraints that can be implemented by
invariants and for implicit constraints that can be maintained during
search through specific neighbourhoods. This backend has been
described more in depth in [BMFP15] and has been first developed as
part of Gustav Björdal's Bachelor thesis [Bjö14]. More info on OscaR
can be found at http://www.oscarlib.org. The CBLS part of OscaR is
developed by Renaud De Landtsheer and Yoann Guyot. OscaR is free
software and distributed under the terms of the LGPL v2.1.
