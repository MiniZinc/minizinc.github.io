This is "fzn-oscar-cbls", a MiniZinc backend using the Oscar/CBLS
solver. It solves problems by using constraint-based local search in
an adapative tabu search setting. Before running the search, the
backend looks for one-way constraints that can be implemented by
invariants and for implicit constraints that can be maintained during
search through specific neighbourhoods. During search the backend
performs propagation, using some parts of OscaR/CP, to reduce the size of the
search space. 
This backend has been described more in depth in [BMFP15] 
and has been first developed as part of Gustav Björdal's bachelor 
thesis [Bjö14]. More info on OscaR can be found at 
http://www.oscarlib.org. The CBLS engine of OscaR is developed at 
CETIC, Belgium, by Renaud De Landtsheer, Yoann Guyot, 
and Gustavo Ospina. OscaR is free software and distributed under
the terms of the LGPL v2.1.
