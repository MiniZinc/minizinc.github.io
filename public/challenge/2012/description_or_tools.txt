See or-tools: http://code.google.com/p/or-tools

OR-Tools is a set Operations Research tools developed internally at Google and open-sourced.

The project contains multiple tools:

 - A Constraint Programming solver
 - A wrapper around third party linear solvers (GLPK. CLP, CBC, SCIP, Sulum).
 - Knapsack algorithms
 - Graph algorithms (shortest paths, min cost flow, max flow, linear sum assignment).


It was build by the Operations Research team at Google.

Internally, it also uses Minisat, and the Coin LP softwares.
