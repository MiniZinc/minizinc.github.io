Mining itemsets with maximal accuracy

Submitted by Tias Guns, Siegfried Nijssen, and Guido Tack.

A traditional task in machine learning is the task of concept learning.
Given a dataset of positive and negative examples, the aim is here to find a 
formula in disjunctive normal form which characterizes the positive examples 
as accurately as possible. In this challenge this task is modeled as a 
discrete constraint optimization problem; the aim is to find a formula which 
is as accurate as possible.

The model is based on the link between DNF formulas and pattern sets in the 
data mining literature. It represents the formula as a set of itemsets, and 
imposes constraints on both the itemsets and the set of itemsets. It is based 
on the 'Constraint Programming for Itemset Mining' framework (CP4IM); see

To run, use either pattern_set_mining_k1.mzn or pattern_set_mining_k2.mzn,
together with any of the dzn files in the data directory. The two models are
identical except for a different value of the parameter K (1 or 2), which
determines the size of the pattern set to be determined.
