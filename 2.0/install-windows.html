<h2>MiniZinc 2</h2>

<h3>Installation Instructions for Windows</h3>

<p>These instructions are for installing MiniZinc 2 from a binary distribution for Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This package only contains the MiniZinc compiler, you will need to
    install FlatZinc solvers manually. For most users, downloading the <a href="../software.html">bundled packages</a>
    is the preferred option!</p>

<p>Download the installer here:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Windows (32 bit):</b> <a class="download" href="https://github.com/MiniZinc/libminizinc/releases/download/{{ mznversion }}/Install.MiniZinc.{{ mznversion }}.win32.exe">Install.MiniZinc.{{ mznversion }}.win32.exe</a>
</ul>

<p>
After downloading, run the installer and follow the instructions.</p>

<h3>Running MiniZinc</h3>

<p>The installer will copy the MiniZinc executables, documentation and examples into the folder you specified (usually the Program Files folder). It also adds shortcuts to the start menu, including a command shell that sets up the path to include the MiniZinc executables.
</p>

<h3>Using MiniZinc 2.0 with the MiniZinc IDE</h3>

<p>
  In order to use MiniZinc 2 with the <a href="/ide/index.html">MiniZinc IDE</a>, you need to change the MiniZinc path in the preferences dialog to point to the <tt>bin</tt> directory inside the MiniZinc installation (usually in Program Files). </p>
