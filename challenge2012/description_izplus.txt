* What is fz_izplus

  fz_izplus is a FlatZinc solver using iZ-C constraint programming
library which is developed by NTT DATA SEKISUI SYSTEMS CORPORATION.

iZ-C provides :
  * many built-in constraints
  * constraint propagation mechanism
  * simple search strategy

And in fz_izplus, following algorithms are 'plus'ed.

  * Randomized restarting in search
    For fast random number generation, Xorshift128 algorithm is used.
       http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper

  * Local search for optimization
      In real world problem, sometimes finding 'good' solution using
    short time is more important than finding 'best' solution using
    long time. And it is known empirically that 'good' solutions are
    similar to each other, then local search can be a good strategy.
    
      For optimization problem, fz_izplus tries to find first solution
    using constraint propagation. After one solution was found, it
    searches similar solutions better than first one.
      To avoid local minimum/maximum problem, multiple solutions are
    preserved for next search start point.
