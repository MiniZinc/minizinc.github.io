MinisatID is an implementation of a search algorithm combining techniques
from SAT, SMT, CP and ASP.
The basis is the SAT-solver MinisatID, extended with propagators for

+ Unfounded set computation
+ Pseudo boolean aggregates (sum, min, max, card, product)
+ QBF solving
+ Constraints over FD variables, namely comparison, sum and product
+ FD variable minimization and subset minimization
+ Supporting addition of new constraints during search

Constraints are either translated to SAT or handled in a lazy clause
generation fashion.  FD variables over large domains are lazy transformed to
SAT.

MinisatID is developed by Broes De Cat and is part of the IDP system.
